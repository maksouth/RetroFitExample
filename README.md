## Demo application for Retrofit2
### About
Application for quick and comfortable weather forecasting.

It uses the most popular weather forecasting tool - OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api). You can get weather forecast just after input the name of the city and days number. Once you get forecast for city - this data is cached. So, next time, even if you do not have internet access, you'll be able to know for sure weather state. For example, if you have got forecast for 10 days, and then return to app in 7 days, without internet access, you'll still have forecast for 3 days. Support portrait and landscape modes.

While developing, the following external libraries and API was used: Retrofit, Realm, Recycler View, OpenWeatherMap API
